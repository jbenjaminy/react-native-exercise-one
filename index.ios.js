// index.ios.js
// apps we build are composed of a collection of many components
    // components are anything to be rendered on the screen.

// Step 1: Import a library to help create the component.
// Import Statements:
    // Part of ES6 -- no file gets global access.
    // Only by importing files or modules can we access code outside of file.
// React Library:
    // Knows how a component should behave.
    // Knows how to take a bunch of components and make them work together.
import React from 'react';
// React Native Library:
    // Knows how to take the output from a component and place it on the screen.
    // Provides default core components (image, text)
import ReactNative from 'react-native';

// Step 2: Create a component.

// Step 3: Render it to the device.
